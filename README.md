Cloud Resume Challenge Architecture

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a popular hands-on project designed to help individuals build practical skills in cloud technologies.
It was designed for cloud enthus to further improve their hands-on skill and to demonstrate knowledge and expertise in cloud computing, particularly on AWS. (Credit for Forrest Brazeal for inventing this challenge)

The challenge involves building and deploying a cloud-based resume website that is fully serverless, secure, and uses modern cloud services. It combines both frontend and backend development, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines, all within a cloud environment. The project also requires integration with APIs and databases to track visitors to your resume site.
But my design was excluded on how developer push/deploy/commit using CI/CD, I may yet do another updates to includes this step which explain the CI/CD portion
